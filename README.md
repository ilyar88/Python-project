About
The project demonstrates a smart automation infrastructure. It is built in hierarchical order of modules. The modules contain several classes with methods. There are main/common /actions/page object modules. In this way, the tests can be created in a very simple way with a minimum line of code. Also, the infrastructure allows us to work with different kinds of applications. A big advantage of the infrastructure is that it can be easily maintained!
